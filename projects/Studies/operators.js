/**
 *  OPERATORS:
 * 
 * 0. Operator's are a reserved syntax used to perform a specific built in action.
 *  The level of importance, or priority, distinguishes what order these operators will
 *  be applied when an expression is being evaluated. These operators are: Assignment, Comparison,
 *  string, Arithmetic, Logical, Relational, Comma, Bigint, Bitwise, Unary, and Ternary. The best thing about
 *  the operators is that they can even be combined together to modify an expression, variable, etc.
 * 
 *  1. Operators and syntax:
 * 
 *  -Assignment => '=' 
 *               (equals)
 *    Assigns a value to the first operand based on the second operand;
 * 
 *  -Comparison => '<,             >,          !,           ==,              ==='  
 *                (less than, greater than, bang/NOT, loosley equals, strictly equals)
 *    Compares two operands and based on if the comparison is true it will return a logical value.
 * 
 *  -String =>  '+ or +='
 *            (concatenate)
 *    Concatenates two string values together and returns a string of the combined strings
 * 
 *  -Arithmetic => '+,      -,             %,           *,      /'  
 *                (add, subtract, remainder/factor, multiply, divide)
 *    Takes two numerical operands and returns a single numerical value
 * 
 *  -Logical => '!, ||, &&' 
 *            (bang, OR, AND)
 *    Used with logical values to return a boolean or a value of the operand
 * 
 
 *  Unary =>
 *  Ternary =>
 *
