 *                                               FUNCTIONS
 * 
 * FUNCTIONS:
 * 
 * 0. A statement, or set of statements, that performs a task or calculates a value. This operation is similar
 * to a procedure. In order to classify as a function, it must take in some input and return an output. Also,
 * the two must have an obvious relationship with one another. Facebook Official, if you will. Furthermore,
 * these requirements are called 'parameters' that are passed to a function by a value.
 * 
 * 
 * 1. The life cycle of a Func - Nonpoint 2002
 * 
 *  There are two steps when it comes to using functions:
 *  First you need to create a function definition or function expression.
 *  Next, the function can be executed by calling, or invoking, it.
 *  Execute, Call, and Invoke mean the same in regards to the function. So, dealer's choice on the verbage.
 * 
 * 2. Differences:
 * -Parameters: These are the names attached to the function's definition.
 *  function par(para1, para2) //<- this function has two paramters named para1 & para2.
 * -Arguments: These are the values passed to the function that initialize the parameters.
 *  par(arg1, arg2) //<- invoking par with arg1 & arg2 as the arguments
 * 
 * 3. Named Function Syntax:
 *  Providing a name allows it to refer to itself and be identified
 * 
 * function par(para1, para2) //<- the name of the function is 'par'
 *
 * 
 * 4. Assigning a Function to a Variable:
 * 
 * 5. functions can optionally take inputs and optionally return a single value. How do we
 * specify inputs and how do we specify outputs
 * 
 * 6. Scope: Functons can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true
 * 
 * 7. Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. if an object returned fromthe function and is
 * held in memory somewhere or referenced that closure stays ALIVE and data can cont to exist in these closures
